# My Recipe App - [Basil Khan](http://basilkhan.ca/)<br>
The goal of this project is to build a simple recipe app where users can input cooking recipes, upload images, save recipes, comment on recipes and share their recipes with friends. The users will have login page. A guest user can also browse the listings anonymously but cannot comment or interact with the content. The code is developed on Cloud 9 IDE and deployed onto Heroku.

Currently working through building associations.

This app is being built with the assistance of Mashrur Hussain's course on Udemy.
